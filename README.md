# 👋 About Zacchary
Hey there! I'm a Systems Administrator based out of Brisbane, Australia. Currently, I'm working for an Animation Studio called Pixel Zoo.

## What are you currently learning?
Currently, I'm building tools to automate various processes at Pixel Zoo as well as designing and deploying networking solutions.

When I'm not at work, or working on a personal project, I'm hanging out with mates, riding motorcycles, playing video games, nerding out over audio and teaching myself animation.
