# 👋 Hi! I'm Zacchary.

Hi! I'm a Web Developer based out of Brisbane Australia that works for Pixel Zoo as a Junior Systems Administrator.

Currently, I'm learning to manage Kubernetes deployments, develop microservices, and build front end applications in Gatsby, React and Chakra UI.

When I'm not at work, or working on a personal project, I'm hanging out with mates, riding motorcycles, playing video games and nerding out over audio.
