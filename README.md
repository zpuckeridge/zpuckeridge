# 👋 About Zacchary
Hey there! I'm a Junior Systems Administrator based out of Brisbane, Australia. Currently, I'm working for an Animation Studio called Pixel Zoo.

# What are you currently learning?
Currently, I'm learning to automate various processes at Pixel Zoo and build real world applications using Python, Django, Gatsby and React.

When I'm not at work, or working on a personal project, I'm hanging out with mates, riding motorcycles, playing video games, nerding out over audio and teaching myself animation.
