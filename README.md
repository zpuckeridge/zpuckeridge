# 👋 Hi! I'm Zacchary.

I'm a self-taught Web Developer based out of Brisbane, Australia with passions for technology, motorcycles, photography and music.

When I'm not working on projects, I'm hanging out with mates, riding motorcycles and playing video games.

At the moment, I'm looking for work in the DevOps space as a Junior with the ability to progress further in that area of expertise.

I am currently learning how to deploy, manage and develop Kubernetes instances, microservices with Python and build front end applications in Nuxt, Vue, Gatsby, React and TailwindCSS.
