- 👋 Hi! My name is Zacchary Puckeridge. I am a Web Developer with passions for technology, motorcycles, photography and music.
- 👀 When I'm not working on projects, I'm hanging out with mates, riding motorcycles and playing video games.
- 👷‍♂️ At the moment, I'm looking for work in the DevOps space as a Junior with the ability to progress further in that area of expertise.
- 📚 I am currently learning how to deploy, manage and develop Kubernetes instances, microservices with Python and build front end applications in Nuxt, Vue, Gatsby, React and TailwindCSS.

Goals: Code every day!
